## Hi, my name is Luis Jimenez ðŸ‘‹

Data Scientist with experience in Business Intelligence and data analysis, bringing a distinctive background in marketing, 3D animation, and VFX. I have collaborated with global brands such as AB InBev and Unilever, and co-created Mar.ia, the first virtual influencer in Mexico.

I stand out for my skills in project management, pipeline and data workflow design, and the ability to combine creative storytelling with data-driven insights to deliver innovative, business-oriented solutions.

Currently, I am consolidating my profile in the data field after completing the Data Science Bootcamp at TripleTen, with a strong focus on Business Intelligence and on generating value for organizations through data analysis and intelligence.
